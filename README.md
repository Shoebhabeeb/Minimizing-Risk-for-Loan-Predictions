# Minimizing-Risk-for-Loan-Predictions

Machine  learning  has  been  having  a  signif-icant  impact  on  financial  lending  in  the  re-cent  times.    It  as  turned  the  tide  on  tra-ditional lending,  allowing for more accurateand  faster  decisions.   From  analysis  of  indi-viduals to analysis of trends and patterns ofthe customers machine learning is extensivelybeing used. In this project, we plan to use thedata from Lending Club, a well-known peer-to-peer lending platform based in San Francisco,  California,  to  build  statistical  modelsthat use various attributes of the borrowersto  predict  the  grades  given  to  loan  applica-tions by the Lending Club. A loan is assigneda  grade  ranging  from  A  through  F  by  tak-ing into account various attributes like creditscore,  several  indicators  of  credit  risk  fromthe credit report and loan application.  Basedon the grade assigned to the loan, the term ofrepayment, interest rates etc are determined.Keywordsâ€”  Data  Mining,  Loan  classification, Machine Learning
